## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements



### What I learned

Well, when i started the proyect i didn´t know how to put the container for the 3 elements in the center of the screen without using the property position, so by reading some of my notes i see how to do it with display:flex, align-items: center and justify-content: center but if u don't assign it a value for the min-height and max-width, the div will not be placed in the center of the screen, so be carefull with that.
